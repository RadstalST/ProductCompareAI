## Problem Statement

In today's digital age, consumers face the daunting task of comparing numerous products before making a purchase decision. The overwhelming amount of information available online often leads to information overload, making it difficult for consumers to gather and analyze relevant data efficiently. As a result, they may struggle to make informed decisions and end up with products that don't meet their needs.
